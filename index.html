            <p>Nowadays, most RPGs regard scenarios as the primary mechanics that drives whole game. As stories come to an end, the whole game is finished, too. Although some developers choose to add hidden elements like dungeons or collectable items to prolong the duration, it makes no difference to gameplays. Without new chapters of scenarios, players just feel unmotivated and tedious. Nevertheless, Xenoblade Chronicles is a distinctly brilliant RPG, it attaches equal importance to gameplays and scenarios. Even the story is over, it still has lots of contents to keep player immersing into this fantasy world. Here, I would attempt to analyze how the developer of Xenoblade Chronicles to design its gameplays.</p>
<p>Xenoblade Chronicles is a JRPG released on Wii Console in 2010, which is developed by Monolith Software. It has been highly recommended by many media, and scored 92 by Metacritic. Many video game media including IGN evaluated it as the best RPG of last generation. </p>
<h1 id="Elaborate-the-Combat-System"><a href="#Elaborate-the-Combat-System" class="headerlink" title="Elaborate the Combat System"></a>Elaborate the Combat System</h1><p>Xenoblade Chronicles abandoned traditional turn-based combats, engaging a mix of real-time and command-based fighting. Developers had devoted great effort, referring to many classic designs of World of Warcraft, to broaden and deepen its mechanics. </p>
<p>Firstly, a variety of character types enable this game to possess fundamental freedom and strategic gameplay. In this game, players could manipulate a team of three members to fight all the battles. Developers apply the classic team collocation pattern of warrior, mage, and priest to the seven controllable characters, and endow them with unique Talent Arts. Namely, the main character Shulk is an assassin, Melia is a mage, Ryan is a traditional tank, while Dunban is a high-agility tank, Riki is a shaman, and one freewoman who can change her combat style through customizing her unique Talent Arts. They are totally different from each other, but perfectly complement each other. Moreover, players could start a chain attack in a battle to deal a huge amount of damage by continuously casting Arts in a certain order. Consequently, this game provides more than 20 kinds of allocations for players to build a team.</p>
<center><img src="http://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/afec3a17ly1fxwzzecmdlj20zk0jzgpy.jpg" alt="" title="Each Character can Equip 8 Common Arts and 1 Fixed Talent Art"></center>

<p>Next, the design of Skills provides further freedom to custom characters. Despite the difference from everyone’s Talent Arts, each character still exclusively owns 5 Skill trees. Every Skill tree has 5 passive Skills which need SP (Skill Points) to unlock. Just like the team allocation, players could liberally equip different Skill trees to change character’s combat style. Additionally, those specific Skills could share to other characters; if these two characters reach a certain Affinity (I will introduce it in the next section). As shown in the graph, a type of shape represents a type of Skill, and each Skill coin could be inserted into other characters’ corresponding slot to enhance their stats. This system seems like just a trivial part of the game, while it is a perfect joint connected different mechanics.</p>
<center><img src="http://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/afec3a17ly1fxwzze8822j20gt09h404.jpg" alt="" title="Each Character could share one another&#39;s Skills"></center>

<p>Besides, two well-designed equipment systems are other methods to enhance character building. One is weapons and armors; the other one is gems. Just like other MMORPGs, Xenoblade Chronicles also classified armors as light, medium and heavy. Party members can equip light armor by default but certain Skills are needed to equip medium and heavy armor. Of course, heavier armors offer more defense in general. Another big difference between classes is the agility, which is an important stat that influences characters’ accuracy and dodging rate. As for the gems, they provide more than 80 kinds of stats or abilities enhancement based on 6 different genres. Gems offer a wider range of customization than equipment alone can provide, which makes a big difference to alter characters’ power.</p>
<center><img src="http://wx2.sinaimg.cn/large/afec3a17ly1fxwzzeejsvj21400p0tcd.jpg" alt="" title="Gems May Alter Character&#39;s Stats"></center>

<p>Obviously, such a huge and complex basic structure will generate much redundancy to burden players without delicate designs. The key to this problem is the fantastic design of progression. It will not be discussed in details, considering the length. Generally, the math work of this game is rigidly accurate to connect and support the whole structure of game, rendering players lots of pleasure companied with enough challenges. Shortly, though the stats punishment from level difference is extreme, players still could made up this gap using all methods I introduced above to make it possible to conquer those mighty enemies that seems invincible. That perfectly satisfied players’ lust of conquest.</p>
<p>Now an excellent combat system is born, while it still has potential to become better. Admittedly, no matter how wonderful the combat system is, it is futile without compatible monster designs. Just as the variety of main characters, monsters also have a great diversity. Despite different kinds of common monsters that progressed with character’s level, there are also over a hundred reinforced fixed-level unique monsters. They not only possess higher stats, but also have more attacking modes and mightier Arts. Moreover, to induce players to dig into the combat system, 4 over-100-level unique monsters (the highest level is lv.120) are waiting for players. In the contrast, character’s max level is just lv. 99. Therefore, it requires players to figure out correct configuration of team, Skills, equipment and gems to conquer them. This is the advanced gameplay hidden behind the mechanics. </p>

<h1 id="Enrich-the-Auxiliary-mechanics"><a href="#Enrich-the-Auxiliary-mechanics" class="headerlink" title="Enrich the Auxiliary mechanics"></a>Enrich the Auxiliary mechanics</h1><p>After finishing the main course of combat system, the next will be the side dishes comprised of many auxiliary mechanics that enrich this game.</p>
<h2 id="Field-exploration"><a href="#Field-exploration" class="headerlink" title="Field exploration"></a><em>Field exploration</em></h2><p>Another pride of Xenoblade Chronicles is its field design, it has not only extremely large-scale terrains and abundant explorable elements, but also intriguing and splendid landscapes. Combining with wonderful fine arts, it provides players with a distinct and astonishing exploring experience. Another important utilization of those fields is deploying all monsters according to their habits and behaviors to bring players the pleasure, surprise and even startle. For instance, wolves on the grasslands, waterfowls by the water, lizardmen in the forts, owls that only appear during nights, and spiders suddenly show up from a cliff. </p>
<center><img src="http://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/afec3a17ly1fxwzzejhepj20wo0idh8e.jpg" alt="" title="Hidden Special Location of Great Makna Falls"></center>

<p>In the world of Xenoblade Chronicles, there are also different weathers as well as days and nights. The background music will change with day-night cycle, a brand-new scenery could be seen in special weather, and some unique monsters only appears at certain time or special weather, too. Moreover, special landmarks and hidden treasures are placed in every area so that players will never get boring while wandering in the wild. </p>
<center><img src="http://wx3.sinaimg.cn/large/afec3a17ly1fxwzze96krj20of0dcwg4.jpg" alt="" title="Special Weather--Shooting Star"></center>

<h2 id="Affinity"><a href="#Affinity" class="headerlink" title="Affinity"></a><em>Affinity</em></h2><p>Another important auxiliary mechanics of Xenoblade Chronicles is the Affinity, which is a measure of the relationship between people. However, it is hard to summarize the whole system only in this section because it is reflected in countless ways and influences all aspects of the game, from battles to the places players visit. </p>
<p>In this paragraph I will concentrate on the Party Affinity, the major part of this system. There are five levels of Affinity between party members, which could be increased by finishing quests, communicating, giving gifts, fighting battles and so on. When one party member’s Affinity with another one reaches a certain level, player would be able to go to a special location for the Heart-to-Heart Moments, a conversation between the two members. This gives players the opportunity to deepen the understanding of each character, as well as get a boost of Affinity. There are other benefits of increasing the Affinity among party members, such as increasing the power of Chain Attacks, increasing the duration of a gem crafting process, and increasing the number of Skills that party members can link. </p>
<center><img src="http://wx4.sinaimg.cn/large/afec3a17ly1fxwzzea0x6j20zk0k0dit.jpg" alt="" title="Affinity Between Main Characters"></center>

<p>As for other parts of the whole Affinity system, I will demonstrate them in the following corresponding sections. </p>
<h2 id="Side-Quests"><a href="#Side-Quests" class="headerlink" title="Side Quests"></a><em>Side Quests</em></h2><p>As an inseparable part of RPGs, Side Quests of Xenoblade Chronicles are designed with great effort as well. Firstly, both quantity and quality of Side Quests are high-level. Quite many Side Quests have independent scenarios and are even composed into a series, which reflect the information of this world from another perspective. And those quests that are in series have different development of story, according to players’ selection. Secondly, Side Quests have some surprisingly inventive mechanics. Every NPC who have a name could be registered in the Affinity Chart after communication. At first, NPCs’ profiles are sporadic in the charts. As players finish related quests gradually, Affinity among those NPCs alters. And their profiles will be connected by lines that represent their Affinity in the charts, until they form a network of NPCs’ relationship. Interestingly, the NPCs’ destinies and Affinity could be changed according to the stories that have been altered by player’s choices. </p>
<center><img src="http://wx1.sinaimg.cn/large/afec3a17ly1fxwzzeehs1j210s0koaez.jpg" alt="" title="Affinity Chart--Network of NPCs&#39; Relations"></center>

<p>Particularly, though many Side Quests are highly playful and rewarded, they must be unlocked when the requirement is met. That is Location Affinity. There are 5 major areas in the world, and each has an independent Affinity. Players could increase it according to quantity of achieved quests; the higher Affinity is, the higher quality of acceptable quests are. Players are also able to trade more kinds of items with local merchants, like weapons &amp; armors, gems, gifts, and Arts Manuals which could upgrade Arts. </p>
<h2 id="Gem-Crafting"><a href="#Gem-Crafting" class="headerlink" title="Gem Crafting"></a><em>Gem Crafting</em></h2><p>Gems are essential equipment to alter stats or give abilities, and could be obtained by crafting or trading. Players can use the Ether Crystals that enemies drop or are found from the Ether Mine to craft any type and level of gems. To craft higher-level gems, higher-quality Ether Crystals are necessary, which means players must combat with mightier enemies or discover Ether Mines that are hidden in special locations. Especially, the highest-level gems could only be produced by crafting. </p>
<p>Crafting requires two members to do, and the Affinity between them will influence the gems that will be created. The strength of Ether Crystals will be increased in each craft turn, once it exceeds 100, Ether Crystals could be changed in to gems, and higher strength will give gems higher quality. Generally, high quality gems can be crafted by members with high affinity because they would get more craft turns, </p>

<h1 id="Combine-Different-Mechanics-Organically"><a href="#Combine-Different-Mechanics-Organically" class="headerlink" title="Combine Different Mechanics Organically"></a>Combine Different Mechanics Organically</h1><p>I have introduced the overview of important mechanics of Xenoblade Chronicles, and each of them are well designed and playful. However, the most important is not the design of single mechanics; it is the designs that make different mechanics organically connected. </p>
<p>All scenarios, quests, collectibles and challenges are different goals for players, while they all have the same procedure¬¬ ¬— battles. Which means. for the Xenoblade Chronicles, battles are its foundation and core to guarantee the gameplay and duration. Battles require players to engage in other activities, like upgrading equipment, enriching inventory and solving quests, while the rewards from battles and quests will repay those activities reversely. Namely, quests provide experience money and rare equipment; field exploration enables player to find unique monsters and rare materials for gem crafting or trading. Furthermore, a bunch of allocations for building a team could maintain players’ interests at a high level. Such a positive feedback loop is exactly the impetus that drives players to keep on playing. </p>
<p>Battles play an important role in the interaction of different mechanics, and literally, it is just like many other outstanding RPGs. However, this structure is just a star-plot that centers on battles. We still need another thread to weave it into a network. That is, the Affinity. </p>
<p>The Party Affinity connects to Skills, Gems Crafting, Chain attacks, Heart-to-Heart Moments. They all could be enhanced due to the increase of Party affinity, and then repay the battle to make it easier or more flexible. For the Location Affinity, it connects to side quiets, trade, and field exploration. As the upgrade of Location Affinity, players could accept rarer Side Quests, trade more items and equipment with NPCs, and unlock more areas and places to explore. Notably, both two types of the Affinity are self-driven, the Party Affinity could be increase by battles, Side Quests and Heart-to-Heart Moments; and the Location Affinity could be increase by Side Quests. Actually, Heart-to-Heart Moments is the ostensible core of Party Affinity, since the new plot is the very direct incentive for players. The Affinity will be upgraded inadvertently by players when they accomplish the necessary battles and quests. Therefore, the Affinity becomes a perfect hidden thread rather than a burden for the game and the players. </p>
<p>If we compare the whole game to a human body, the scenario is the head that take control; combat system is the heart that drives the whole body; other mechanics, like Field Exploration, Side Quests, equipment and so on, are other main organs that enrich this body; then the Affinity must be the blood that transfers among all of them.</p>

However, once player walk through the grass tile, spikes will come up from underground. Player should avoid stepping on those spikes again, otherwise player will return to the start point. </p>
<p>The teleportation gate is closed at first. When player passes the grass tiles on top right of the field, a skeleton (pointed by red arrow) will show up. Then player could go to check the corpse and the gate will open. Meanwhile, present spikes will disappear. </p>

<h1 id="Level-1-3"><a href="#Level-1-3" class="headerlink" title="Level 1-3"></a>Level 1-3</h1><p>Player should get out of the maze with mobs that block the only way. If player approaches the mob from his front and side, player will be caught and return to the start point.</p>
<p>However, if player approaches the mob from his back, player could eliminate him and the blocked ways will become passable. Additionally, the correct route is marked by the white flowers served as a hint.</p>

<h1 id="Level-1-4"><a href="#Level-1-4" class="headerlink" title="Level 1-4"></a>Level 1-4</h1><p>It is still a simple level. Player should tell the NPC a 4-digit password to go to the next level. And the password is the shape of tussock, which is obvious on the field.</p>

<h1 id="Level-2-1"><a href="#Level-2-1" class="headerlink" title="Level 2-1"></a>Level 2-1</h1><p>This level combines the Level 1-1 and Level 1-2, becoming a little more complicated. The tiles among those torches are deployed with spike traps. Player still should light up all torches, but now he must watch out the spikes. </p>
<p>Only one entry and one exit are available now, but the correct route is more than one. If player steps on the spike accidentally, he must start it over.</p>

<h1 id="Level-2-2"><a href="#Level-2-2" class="headerlink" title="Level 2-2"></a>Level 2-2</h1><p>This level combines the Level 1-2 and Level 1-4, which makes it more interesting. At first, there is nothing in the anticipated password area. But if player walks through the whole area, tussock will show up and indicate the answer. It is something like scratch tickets. </p>
<p>But there is still a small trick: the number is not displayed by the shape of tussock but the tiles of ground.</p>

<h1 id="Level-2-3"><a href="#Level-2-3" class="headerlink" title="Level 2-3"></a>Level 2-3</h1><p>Just like previous levels, this is also a combined level, which derives form Level 1-3 and Level 1-2. In this level, the teleportation gate will open only after all five mobs are eliminated. While spike traps are deployed at the crossings, player should carefully calculate the route.</p>

<h1 id="Level-3-1"><a href="#Level-3-1" class="headerlink" title="Level 3-1"></a>Level 3-1</h1><p>Now, the difficulty is a little increased. Not only spikes are among the torches, but mobs also block the player’s way. The barricade in front of the teleportation gate will disappear once all torches are lit up. And the teleportation gate will open after all mobs are eliminated.</p>
<p>It is also a little tricky, because player may feel difficult to achieve the two goals inside the matrix of torches. However, if player could get outside the formation and light up all torches first, it will become much easy.</p>

<h1 id="Level-3-2"><a href="#Level-3-2" class="headerlink" title="Level 3-2"></a>Level 3-2</h1><p>This is the final level, still a password level. However in the anticipated area, the answer is incomplete. The lost parts are in the lower area, which will show up after player walk through the tiles. But the order of lower parts seems wrong; they couldn’t match the parts right above them. Only after investigating the mobs, the hint of matching pattern will show up. </p>
<p>It requires player to observe the scene carefully, and associate the meaning of tussock’s shapes and the meaning of decorations. </p>

<h1 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h1><p>Basically, the mechanics in my demo are simple and common. But my thought is to combine these simple mechanics together and then derive a new gameplay. The derived levels are much different form original ones, and the difficulties are increased at the same time. Additionally, the combinations also generate some interesting experiences. For instance, Level 2-1 combines the mechanics of spike traps into Level 1-2, plays like scratching a lottery ticket. </p>
<p>I think this kind of design enable player to adapt to the levels faster, while the combination revitalizes the repeated mechanics and increases the difficulty gradually, which will bring player a lot of new experiences. </p>
